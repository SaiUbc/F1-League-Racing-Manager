## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Bugs
If you encounter any bugs or issues while using the system, please let me know by creating an issue on GitHub.

- **Check for existing issues**: Before submitting a new issue, please check the [Issues](https://https://github.com/SaiUbc/F1-League-Racing-Manager/issues) page to see if it has already been reported.
- **Provide details**: When reporting an issue, please include:
  - A descriptive title.
  - Detailed steps to reproduce the issue.
  - Your operating system and Python version.
  - Any relevant error messages or screenshots.

### 2. Suggesting Enhancements
If you have ideas for new features or improvements, I'd love to hear them!

- **Open a new issue**: Create an issue with a clear and descriptive title.
- **Explain the rationale**: Describe the enhancement in detail, explaining why it would be beneficial and how it fits within the project’s scope.

### 3. Submitting Code Changes
If you would like to contribute code, please follow these guidelines:

- **Fork the repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
- **Create a new branch**: For each feature or bug fix, create a new branch:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

- Write tests: Ensure your code is well-tested. Add unit tests for any new functionality.

- Follow coding standards: Keep the code style consistent with the rest of the project. Run flake8 or another linter to check for code style issues.

- Commit messages: Write clear and descriptive commit messages. Group related changes into a single commit whenever possible.

- Submit a pull request: Once your changes are ready, push them to your fork and open a pull request (PR) against the main branch of the original repository. In your PR, please:
    - Describe the changes in detail.
    - Reference any related issues.
    - Request feedback if you’re unsure about any part of the implementation.

### 4. Code Reviews
I value code quality and maintainability, so all pull requests will undergo a review process:

- Be patient: Code reviews take time.
- Be open to feedback: I may suggest changes or ask questions about your code.
- Make requested changes: If changes are requested, update your branch and push the changes. The PR will automatically update.
